<!-- 
    The project.xml generates build environments for:

        * android
        * autotool
        * cmake
        * mingw32
        * vs2008
        * vs2010
        * vs2012
        * vs2013

    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source 
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.
